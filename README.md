# placethings

An framework allows user to 

(1) emulate a network virtual or real <b>THINGs</b>, including
- data sources, e.g. virtual or real sensors
- network devices, e.g. switches, mininet switches
- servers and edge devices, e.g. virtual machines, containers, and bare metal devices

(2) define computation tasks and find an optimal solution to <b>PLACE</b> them on those virtual or bare metal servers and edge devices
